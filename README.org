#+TITLE: go-ipld example

The new way of using IPLD with RPC to kubo was not clear to me. I didn't know
how I should manipulate ipld nodes, marshall/unmarshall them, or navigate
through them. In this example, I do the following:

1. Use =basicnode= to unmarshall ipld data from codec to data structure.
2. Use a =LinkSystem= (wrapping =rpc.Block()= to make the following the links
   created by =basicnode= possible.
3. Use a =selector= to facilitate the traversal (without a bunch type casts) of a
   tree of *multiple nodes*.
